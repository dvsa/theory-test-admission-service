#Compare video to image

##Depricated

This lambda work as a filler for the current version of the step function "complete-admission", at this moment (Mar 21 2018 ) AWS do not offer an api to directly compare an image to a video, the correct method at this moment is to create a collection with a single image and use the compare-video-to-image-collection-interface
