# Theory Test Admission Service

This Git Repository contains code for artifacts comprising the Admission Service.

The Admission Service imagines that a physical Test Centre is provided by a franchisee.

A Theory Test candidate would attend the physical Test Centre at a pre-arranged time; upon arrival they would use the 
Admission Service to authenticate themselves, and thus begin the Theory Test process.

The service therefore involves two user interfaces:
- one for candidates,
- the other for staff.
